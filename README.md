# Twice-Detrended-Residual-Method
Code for applying the Twice Detrended Residual Method to pattern recognition in non-stationary data, particularly applied to combined sewer system flow data.

Steps to run code:

Either download the code and datasets or clone the repository.

Open file named ParentCode.m
  -all other codes are run from this. The other codes can be modified and then run from this code.
  -Run each line of the code, it should ask you to select which dataset you would like analyze. 

  -The code is all replicated in the smoothing folder so the steps are the same.
  
Run each block of code to step through the functions.
